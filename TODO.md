Build a robust, reliable system that detects patterns in video streams using GStreamer and Deepstream. The system should be able to handle custom detection strategies, manage alerts with throttling, and provide a flexible API for pattern detection.

The system must be robust to errors, with automatic recovery from failures. It should also provide logging and monitoring capabilities to track the performance and status of the pattern detection.

The system must be designed to work with multiple video sources (rtsp, webrtc, file, etc.) simultaneously and support real-time processing. It should be able to handle different video formats and resolutions, and provide a way to configure the detection parameters for each pattern. It should also provide a way to register and unregister (and enable or disable) video sources dynamically.

The system should be modular, allowing for easy addition of new detection strategies and patterns. It should also provide a way to register and unregister patterns dynamically.

The system should offer a user-friendly interface for configuring and managing detection patterns, including the ability to adjust parameters on-the-fly and visualize detection results in real-time.

The system is a standalone application that can be run independently or integrated into other applications. It should provide a way to run the pattern detection in a separate thread or process, and communicate with the main application via a message bus or similar mechanism. (e.g. it is not actually part of SMOD)

The system should be designed to be extensible, allowing for easy addition of new features and improvements in the future.

The system should be designed to be efficient and performant, with low latency and high throughput. It should be able to handle high-resolution video streams and process multiple streams simultaneously without significant performance degradation.

It should use deepstream streamer elements for video processing, and provide a way to configure the pipeline dynamically. It should also provide a way to monitor the performance of the pipeline and detect any issues that may arise during processing.
