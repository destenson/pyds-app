# Minimum confidence level (0-100, higher = more confident it's dead code)
# 80 is a good balance between false positives and catching real dead code
--min-confidence=80

# Sort results by file size (helpful for prioritizing cleanup)

# Include decorators that indicate used code

# Include names that look unused but are legitimate

# Use whitelist file for more complex patterns
