# Execute BASE PRP

Implement a feature using using the PRP file.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Process

1. **Load PRP**
   - Read the specified PRP file
   - Understand all context and requirements
   - Follow all instructions in the PRP and extend the research if needed
   - Ensure you have all needed context to implement the PRP fully
   - Do more web searches and codebase exploration as needed
   - If there are any ambiguities or uncertainties, ask the user for clarification before proceeding, and update the PRP accordingly.
   - If the PRP is incomplete, use the following steps to complete it:
     - **Research**: Use the research process outlined in the PRP to gather all necessary information.
     - **Clarification**: Ask the user for any missing details or examples.
     - **Documentation**: Ensure all relevant documentation is included in the PRP.
     - **Code Examples**: Reference existing code snippets that align with the implementation requirements.
     - **Patterns**: Identify and follow existing patterns in the codebase.

2. **ULTRATHINK**
   - Think hard before you execute the plan. Create a comprehensive plan addressing all requirements.
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps using your todos tools.
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to create and track your implementation plan.
   - Identify implementation patterns from existing code to follow.

3. **Execute the plan**
   - Execute the PRP
   - Implement all the code

4. **Validate**
   - Run each validation command
   - Fix any failures
   - Re-run until all pass

5. **Complete**
   - Ensure all checklist items done
   - Run final validation suite
   - Report completion status
   - Read the PRP again to ensure you have implemented everything

6. **Reference the PRP**
   - You can always reference the PRP as needed

Note: If validation fails, use error patterns in PRP to fix and retry.

Note: If you seem to be having trouble doing something, like modifying a file or creating a directory, alert the user to the issue and ask for help.
